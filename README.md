# 🩸 Thalassemia Patient–Donor Management System

A full-stack healthcare application designed to streamline **patient appointment booking**, **donor assignment**, and **confirmation workflows** for blood banks treating thalassemia patients.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Thalassemia patients require **regular and timely blood transfusions**.
Blood banks often face challenges like:

* Manual donor coordination
* Last-minute donor unavailability
* Poor communication between patients, donors, and blood banks

This system digitizes and automates the entire process to ensure **reliability, transparency, and timely care**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👤 Patient

* Book blood transfusion appointments through the app
* View appointment status and confirmations

### 🏥 Blood Bank Admin

* Dashboard to manage patient requests
* Assign donors based on availability and schedule
* Track donor confirmations in real time

### 🧑‍🦱 Donor

* Receive automated email notification when assigned
* Accept or reject appointments from the mobile app
* Confirm availability in advance (e.g., 4 days before patient arrival)

---

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. Patient books an appointment from the app
2. Request appears on the Blood Bank dashboard
3. Admin assigns a donor for the required date
4. Backend automatically sends an email notification to the donor
5. Donor opens the app and confirms availability
6. Confirmation status is reflected back on the admin dashboard

This ensures donors are **confirmed in advance**, reducing last-minute failures.
